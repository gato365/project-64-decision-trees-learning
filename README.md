# project-64-decision-trees-learning

## Current Plans


### Today (40 minutes):
1. **Understanding the CART Algorithm Basics (10 minutes)**
   - Briefly review the fundamentals of the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, focusing on how it splits data based on the best attributes.
   
2. **Data Preparation (10 minutes)**
   - Use the first 10 minutes today to ensure your data (like the dataset we've created) is ready for modeling. This includes checking the distribution of the classes and understanding how the data might influence the splits.

3. **Starting the Decision Tree Construction (20 minutes)**
   - Begin coding the algorithm to handle the initial split. Focus on choosing the split based on the GPA attribute, calculating impurity (like Gini index), and making the first split decision between "Hire", "Reject", and "Waitlist".

### Tomorrow (60 minutes):
1. **Complete the Decision Tree Construction (30 minutes)**
   - Continue where you left off, handling subsequent splits and refining the tree construction process. Implement the complete splitting based on the GPA range that dictates different statuses.

2. **Visualization and Interpretation (15 minutes)**
   - Once the tree is built, visualize it to better understand the decision paths and how GPA influences the student status. This helps in interpreting the results and explaining how decisions are made.

3. **Testing and Validation (15 minutes)**
   - Finally, test the decision tree with some sample data points to see how it classifies new inputs. This could be a good checkpoint to evaluate the performance and make any necessary adjustments.
